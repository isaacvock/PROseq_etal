# PROseq_etal
Snakemake workflow pipeline for processing PRO-seq and ChIP-seq data. Support for other modalities (NET-seq/ATAC-seq/etc.) will likely be added in the future.

## Getting Started

Head over to [PROseq_etal's website](https://proseq-etal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for in-depth instructions for running the pipeline, as well as additional documentation!

## Status

The main branch of PROseq_etal is stable and implements a full data processing pipeline for PRO-seq and ChIP-seq experiments. Development is active and ongoing though, and requests for enhancements/additions can be made by posting them to the Issues page of this repository.
