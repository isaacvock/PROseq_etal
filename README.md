# PROseq_etal
Snakemake workflow pipeline for processing PRO-seq and ChIP-seq data. Support for other modalities (NET-seq/ATAC-seq/etc.) will likely be added in the future.

## Getting Started

Head over to the [documentation](https://pipelinedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) describing how to run Snakemake pipelines like PROseq_etal, as well as information specific to PROseq_etal's configuration and output.

Here is a link to [the old PROseq_etal's website](https://proseq-etal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for posterity's sake. Only the general purpose one-stop-documentation-shop will remain up-to-date.

## Status

The main branch of PROseq_etal is stable and implements a full data processing pipeline for PRO-seq and ChIP-seq experiments. Development is active and ongoing though, and requests for enhancements/additions can be made by posting them to the Issues page of this repository.
